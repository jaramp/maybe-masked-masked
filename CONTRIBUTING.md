## 💻 Building Locally

You can build the mod locally using the [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download).

### Basic Build Command

From the root of the repository, run:

```bash
dotnet build -c Release
```

This compiles the mod and runs all configured build steps.

### Build Outputs

The compiled DLL will appear under `NameOfMod/bin/Release/netstandard2.1/`. The DLL will also be automatically copied into your BepInEx plugins folder. See variables in `NameOfMod.csproj`:

- `GameDir`: Install location for Lethal Company
- `BepInExDir`: Location of active BepInEx folder, which may depend on your mod manager.

`build.targets` will run the following automation:

1. **Version Sync**: Ensures the Thunderstore `manifest.json` version matches the `.csproj` version.
2. **Changelog Check**: If the changelog does not contain the current version, prints a warning message.
3. **Thunderstore Packaging**: Creates the zip file to upload to Thunderstore under `/builds`.
4. **Auto-Copy To Mod Folder**: Puts the DLL into the appropriate location from `BepInExDir` for immediate testing.

You can comment out any of these targets if you don't want them to execute on your local machine.

## 🐞 Reporting Bugs or Asking Questions

- Check the **README** first: it covers how to use and configure the mod.
- If the issue isn’t covered, open a **GitHub Issue** with:
  - Steps to reproduce (if it’s a bug)
  - Expected vs. actual behavior
  - Any relevant screenshots or log snippets

Questions and suggestions can go in issues, too (just label them accordingly).
